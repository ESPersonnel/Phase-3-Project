## Current Progress

### Backend

The backend is currently complete. It has all the required routes and controllers. The database is seeded with data.

Any other informational data will be added to this section as the project progresses.

### Frontend

The frontend is coming along but is not complete. The application can currently do the following:

- Displays all the book details from the Backend database.
- Displays all the author details from the Backend database.
- Displays all the review details from the Backend database.

Functionality to be added:

- Functionality to add, edit and delete books, authors and reviews.
- Styling to make the application look better.

## Features added and rolled back

### Frontend

- Added Firebase authentication but rolled it back because it was not working properly and wasted my time.
- Added a search bar but it broke my application so I rolled it back.

> Note: These features will be added back in the future. This might be a good project to present as a portfolio piece so I want to make it look good.
